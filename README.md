# Full-Stack-App-EC2-Deployment
## I developed and deployed a full-stack web application on an AWS EC2 instance.
The application includes a React frontend (built with Vite) and a Node.js backend using Express. I manually set up an EC2 instance running Ubuntu, connected to it via SSH, and installed all necessary packages including Node.js and npm. I deployed the backend server to run on a specific port and served the React frontend by building the production version using npm run build and using a simple static file server like serve. I also configured the EC2 security groups to allow HTTP and custom port access, making the application accessible via the instanceâ€™s public IP. This hands-on deployment gave me practical experience with AWS, Linux server setup, and managing a production environment
